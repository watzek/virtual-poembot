Day in April,Title,Author + date,Text,Final line (if this is possible)
1,Somewhere or Other,Christina Rossetti (1830-1894),"Somewhere or other there must surely be
The face not seen, the voice not heard,
The heart that not yet—never yet—ah me!
Made answer to my word.

Somewhere or other, may be near or far;
Past land and sea, clean out of sight;
Beyond the wandering moon, beyond the star
That tracks her night by night.

Somewhere or other, may be far or near;
With just a wall, a hedge, between;
With just the last leaves of the dying year
Fallen on a turf grown green.",
2,Quatrains,Gwendolyn Bennett (1902-1981),"1
Brushes and paints are all I have
To speak the music in my soul--
While silently there laughs at me
A copper jar beside a pale green bowl.

2
How strange that grass should sing--
Grass is so still a thing ...
And strange the swift surprise of snow
So soft it falls and slow.",
3,manhã,"Marc-Anthony Valle, '22","By the time I wake, the sun is already on its third cup of black coffee.
My nose dry as farofa.
I slept under the air conditioner.
My vovó is asleep still. 
Moving her is labor we all shoulder happily.
My oh my oh my how she could love.
Her skin soft palm leaves sunbathing on their back.
I felt my bruises decolor and scratches cauterize when she embraced me.
I wrap her palms around my blistered back.
My vovô is reading now. As he always did.
Wall of leather-bound books behind him, well-worn and colored, as his own binding.
I long to carry him home with me, toting household gods whose names I can’t decipher.
Take him to where the sun is blocked by evergreens.
Carry my grandfather like Anchises.",
4,The Gardener 85,Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941),"Who are you, reader, reading my poems an hundred years hence?
I cannot send you one single flower from this wealth of the spring, one single streak of gold from yonder clouds.
Open your doors and look abroad.

From your blossoming garden gather fragrant memories of the vanished flowers of an hundred years before.
In the joy of your heart may you feel the living joy that sang one spring morning, sending its glad voice across an hundred years.",
5,Spring,Edna St. Vincent Millay (1892-1950),"To what purpose, April, do you return again?
Beauty is not enough.
You can no longer quiet me with the redness
Of little leaves opening stickily.
I know what I know.
The sun is hot on my neck as I observe
The spikes of the crocus.
The smell of the earth is good.
It is apparent that there is no death.
But what does that signify?
Not only under ground are the brains of men
Eaten by maggots.
Life in itself
Is nothing,
An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.
It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,
April
Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.",
6,Sunflowers,"Keeley Jo Alexander, '21","Look at the Sunflowers
Staring out with pride,
And their beauty it shines
Like a beacon of light
When the wind 
 blows around them
They sway to the song
Tall and high and mighty
They are flowers,
But they’re strong.

Whisper to the Lavender
And she’ll sing you a tune
She’s as quiet as a butterfly
As vibrant as the moon
When the wind
 blows around her
Feel laughter through the rain
She will bring you a smile
Even when you’re in pain.

You should know
You’re one in a million
No flowers to compare to
And summer sunshine
 isn’t as brilliant
Winters don’t even dare to
Try and freeze up your spirit 
But they couldn’t if they tried
Don’t you ever let anybody
Dampen out your light.",
7,On A Quiet Night,Li Po (701-762),"I saw the moonlight before my couch. 
And wondered if it were not the frost on the ground.
I raised my head and looked out on the mountain moon;
I bowed my head and thought of my far-off home.",
8,The Brain,Emily Dickinson (1830-1886),"The brain is wider than the sky,
   For, put them side by side,
The one the other will include
   With ease, and you beside.

The brain is deeper than the sea,
   For, hold them, blue to blue,
The one the other will absorb,
   As sponges, buckets do.

The brain is just the weight of God,
   For, lift them, pound for pound,
And they will differ, if they do,
   As syllable from sound.",
9,I Know My Soul,Claude McKay (1889-1948),"I plucked my soul out of its secret place,
And held it to the mirror of my eye,
To see it like a star against the sky,
A twitching body quivering in space,
A spark of passion shining on my face.
And I explored it to determine why
This awful key to my infinity
Conspires to rob me of sweet joy and grace.
And if the sign may not be fully read,
If I can comprehend but not control,
I need not gloom my days with futile dread,
Because I see a part and not the whole.
Contemplating the strange, I’m comforted
By this narcotic thought: I know my soul.",
10,late june,"Luke Rotello, '22","beloved me and the cornerstones of my skin,
coated in wild sumac,
tearing up the asphalt 
and the telephone wire draped over lilac aroma.

and you pulled the dendrites from the clover flowers,
you dragged the ambrosia through your teeth
hoping for the return of nectar
and magenta to coat your lips.
you were the six closest depths and their ghosts,
the indica flowers that grew in their farthest reaches,
my symbiosis and guilt.

i don't honestly know who this is for.
maybe this is the 100 feet of rock at bishop's creek and her branches,
or the cobwebs under the bridge turned hazel with ivy.
maybe this is levi, eric and the most i ever loved myself.
or maybe this is healing as i wrap myself in the empty roads to stockbridge,
whisking past the sumac,
the clover, the rhododendron,
the heavy of the sunset and her haze.
because i am made of nothing more than hope, i will choose to believe them all,
and trust they will do the same for me.",
11,Sympathy,Paul Laurence Dunbar (1872-1906),"I know what the caged bird feels, alas!
   When the sun is bright on the upland slopes;
When the wind stirs soft through the springing grass,
And the river flows like a stream of glass;
   When the first bird sings and the first bud opes,
And the faint perfume from its chalice steals--
I know what the caged bird feels!

I know why the caged bird beats its wing
   Till its blood is red on the cruel bars;
For he must fly back to his perch and cling
When he fain would be on the bough a-swing;
   And a pain still throbs in the old, old scars
And they pulse again with a keener sting--
I know why he beats his wing!

I know why the caged bird sings, ah me,
   When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,--
When he beats his bars and he would be free;
It is not a carol of joy or glee,
   But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,
But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings--
I know why the caged bird sings!",
12,Evening Song,Willa Cather (1873-1947),"Dear love, what thing of all the things that be 
Is ever worth one thought from you or me, 
             Save only Love, 
             Save only Love?

The days so short, the nights so quick to flee, 
The world so wide, so deep and dark the sea, 
              So dark the sea; 

So far the suns and every listless star, 
Beyond their light—Ah! dear, who knows how far, 
             Who knows how far? 

One thing of all dim things I know is true, 
The heart within me knows, and tells it you, 
             And tells it you. 

So blind is life, so long at last is sleep, 
And none but Love to bid us laugh or weep, 
             And none but Love, 
             And none but Love. ",
13,"Haley Wildhirt, '22",,"you’re sitting right here
less than five feet away
(maybe less than three i’ve
never been good with distance)
and i can feel a small bubble
sandwiched between my vocal
chord and my trachea just
pleading to be popped

and then a rock falls from 
the cliff of my tongue and 
hits the pit of my stomach
with a massive whomp and
i decide no, maybe it’s better
if we leave the bubble un-
popped and just let it
slowly deflate with time

but the thing is, the thing
is that i’ve already slipped an
i love you into your book bag 
and i’m praying to all the gods
that have ever been created
that you do not draw it out
as you ruffle between papers and
notebooks and forgotten
projects and inkless pens because
the thing is
the thing is

words exist so much easier
in a blank room and i don’t
feel the need to smother them into
unconsciousness, they don’t
struggle to breathe beneath the
nearly four hundred pounds
you being right here
right here
less than five feet away
(or is it three?) i’ve never
been good with distance",
14,The Night is Darkening round Me,Emily Bronte (1818-1840),"The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow ;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow ;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below ;
But nothing drear can move me :
I will not, cannot go.",
15,from The Waste Land,T. S. Eliot (1888-1965),"The river sweats
Oil and tar
The barges drift
With the turning tide
Red sails
Wide
To leeward, swing on the heavy spar.
The barges wash
Drifting logs
Down Greenwich reach
Past the Isle of Dogs.
   Weialala leia
   Wallala leialala

Elizabeth and Leicester
Beating oars
The stern was formed
A gilded shell
Red and gold
The brisk swell
Rippled both shores
Southwest wind
Carried down stream
The peal of bells
White towers

   Wallala leialala",
16,On Monsieur's Departure,Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603),"I grieve and dare not show my discontent,
I love and yet am forced to seem to hate,
I do, yet dare not say I ever meant,
I seem stark mute but inwardly do prate.
I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned,
Since from myself another self I turned.

My care is like my shadow in the sun,
Follows me flying, flies when I pursue it,
Stands and lies by me, doth what I have done.
His too familiar care doth make me rue it.
No means I find to rid him from my breast,
Till by the end of things it be supprest.

Some gentler passion slide into my mind,
For I am soft and made of melting snow;
Or be more cruel, love, and so be kind.
Let me or float or sink, be high or low.
Or let me live with some more sweet content,
Or die and so forget what love ere meant.",
17,Little Red Wagon,"Olivia Allen, '23","Little red wagon I'm a kid I'm a teen 
Little red wagon all the things that I've seen

Little red house I am young I still play
Little red house slowly fading away

Little red hands making stains on the floor
Little red hands not so little no more
 
Little red heart beating quick in my chest
Little red heart will go still like the rest

Little red wagon you appeared with a shine
Little red wagon you are no longer mine",
18,Of the Surface of Things,Wallace Stevens (1879-1955),"I

In my room, the world is beyond my understanding;
But when I walk I see that it consists of three or four
        hills and a cloud.

II

From my balcony, I survey the yellow air,
Reading where I have written,
""The spring is like a belle undressing.""

III

The gold tree is blue,
The singer has pulled his cloak over his head.
The moon is in the folds of the cloak.",
19,Sonnets from the Portuguese 1: I Thought how Theocritus,Elizabeth Barrett (1806-1861),"I thought once how Theocritus had sung
Of the sweet years, the dear and wished for years,
Who each one in a gracious hand appears
To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:
And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,
I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,
The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,
Those of my own life, who by turns had flung
A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,
So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move
Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair,
And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, ...
'Guess now who holds thee?'--'Death,' I said. But there,
The silver answer rang ... 'Not Death, but Love.'",
20,Sonnet VII [O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell],John Keats (1795-1821),"O Solitude! if I must with thee dwell,
Let it not be among the jumbled heap
Of murky buildings; climb with me the steep,--
Nature’s observatory--whence the dell,
Its flowery slopes, its river’s crystal swell,
May seem a span; let me thy vigils keep
’Mongst boughs pavillion’d, where the deer’s swift leap
Startles the wild bee from the fox-glove bell.
But though I’ll gladly trace these scenes with thee,
Yet the sweet converse of an innocent mind,
Whose words are images of thoughts refin’d,
Is my soul’s pleasure; and it sure must be
Almost the highest bliss of human-kind,
When to thy haunts two kindred spirits flee.",
21,Voices of the Air,Katherine Mansfield (1888-1923),"But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.
The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats --
The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these --
For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes.",
22,Moonrise,H.D. (1886-1961),"Will you glimmer on the sea?	
Will you fling your spear-head	
On the shore?	
What note shall we pitch?	
 
We have a song,	        
On the bank we share our arrows—	
The loosed string tells our note:	
 
O flight,	
Bring her swiftly to our song.	
She is great,	        
We measure her by the pine-trees.",
23,Sonnet 98,William Shakespeare (1564-1616),"From you have I been absent in the spring,
When proud-pied April, dressed in all his trim,
Hath put a spirit of youth in everything,
That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.
Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell
Of different flowers in odour and in hue,
Could make me any summer’s story tell,
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew:
Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white,
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
They were but sweet, but figures of delight
Drawn after you, -- you pattern of all those.
    Yet seem’d it winter still, and, you away,
    As with your shadow I with these did play.","Happy birthday, Shakespeare!"
24,It happened,"Alix Faith, '21","Drunk on a plane in a pandemic

Doesn’t seem like something could happen

But with germs in the air 

And spiders in hair

It all appears mundane somethings. 

Take the books off the shelf and burn them

Knowledge killed dead by survival 

In a couple years we’ll look back 

Smile and laugh

We spread fear quicker than any virus 

But breathe now

And 

Wash 

Your 

Hands",
25,Queen-Anne's-Lace,William Carlos Williams (1883-1963),"Her body is not so white as
anemone petals nor so smooth--nor
so remote a thing. It is a field
of the wild carrot taking
the field by force; the grass
does not raise above it.
Here is no question of whiteness,
white as can be, with a purple mole
at the center of each flower.
Each flower is a hand's span
of her whiteness. Wherever
his hand has lain there is
a tiny purple blemish. Each part
is a blossom under his touch
to which the fibres of her being
stem one by one, each to its end,
until the whole field is a
white desire, empty, a single stem,
a cluster, flower by flower,
a pious wish to whiteness gone over--
or nothing.",
26,Diligence Is to Magic as Progress Is to Flight,Marianne Moore (1887-1972),"With an elephant to ride upon--""with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes,""
   she shall outdistance calamity anywhere she goes.
Speed is not in her mind inseparable from carpets. Locomotion arose
   in the shape of an elephant; she clambered up and chose
to travel laboriously. So far as magic carpets are concerned, she knows
   that although the semblance of speed may attach to scarecrows
of aesthetic procedure, the substance of it is embodied in such of those
   tough-grained animals as have outstripped man’s whim to suppose
them ephemera, and I have earned that fruit of their ability to endure blows
   which dubs them prosaic necessities--not curios.",
27,Tragedy of the Farmhand,"Coltyn Cody, '20","You’ve always had a thing for farmer boys,
The way they till the crops, and cultivate,
The way they spit their seed on fertile mounds,
The way they churn the butter, in and out.
And how you long to be those crops,
 To be those mounds,
 To be his buttered—
“You're mighty good” escapes in shallow breaths
…
You wish that he was too.
It’s like you always have to do the work,
The heavy lifting left to expert hands.
He flexes and releases, muscles tense
And then relax. They always disappoint.",
28,Let Me Not Lose My Dream,Georgia Douglas Johnson (1880-1966),"Let me not lose my dream, e'en though I scan the veil
with eyes unseeing through their glaze of tears,
Let me not falter, though the rungs of fortune perish
as I fare above the tumult, praying purer air,
Let me not lose the vision, gird me, Powers that toss
the worlds, I pray!
Hold me, and guard, lest anguish tear my dreams away!",
29,El Beso,Angelina Weld Grimké (1880-1958),"Twilight--and you
Quiet--the stars; 
Snare of the shine of your teeth, 
Your provocative laughter, 
The gloom of your hair; 
Lure of you, eye and lip; 
Yearning, yearning, 
Languor, surrender; 
Your mouth, 
And madness, madness, 
Tremulous, breathless, flaming, 
The space of a sigh; 
Then awakening—remembrance, 
Pain, regret--your sobbing; 
And again, quiet--the stars, 
Twilight--and you.",
