Quatrains

By Gwendolyn Bennett (1902-1981)

1
Brushes and paints are all I have
To speak the music in my soul--
While silently there laughs at me
A copper jar beside a pale green bowl.

2
How strange that grass should sing--
Grass is so still a thing ...
And strange the swift surprise of snow
So soft it falls and slow.
