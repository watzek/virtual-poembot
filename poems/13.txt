the thing is

Haley Wildhirt '22

you’re sitting right here
less than five feet away
(maybe less than three i’ve
never been good with distance)
and i can feel a small bubble
sandwiched between my vocal
chord and my trachea just
pleading to be popped

and then a rock falls from
the cliff of my tongue and
hits the pit of my stomach
with a massive whomp and
i decide no, maybe it’s better
if we leave the bubble un-
popped and just let it
slowly deflate with time

but the thing is, the thing
is that i’ve already slipped an
i love you into your book bag
and i’m praying to all the gods
that have ever been created
that you do not draw it out
as you ruffle between papers and
notebooks and forgotten
projects and inkless pens because
the thing is
the thing is

words exist so much easier
in a blank room and i don’t
feel the need to smother them into
unconsciousness, they don’t
struggle to breathe beneath the
nearly four hundred pounds
you being right here
right here
less than five feet away
(or is it three?) i’ve never
been good with distance
