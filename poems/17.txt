Little Red Wagon

By Olivia Allen, '23

Little red wagon I'm a kid I'm a
   teen
Little red wagon all the things
   that I've seen

Little red house I am young I
   still play
Little red house slowly fading
   away

Little red hands making stains
   on the floor
Little red hands not so little
   no more

Little red heart beating quick
   in my chest
Little red heart will go still
   like the rest

Little red wagon you appeared
   with a shine
Little red wagon you are no
   longer mine
