Sunflowers

Keeley Jo Alexander, '21

Look at the Sunflowers
Staring out with pride,
And their beauty it shines
Like a beacon of light
When the wind
blows around them
They sway to the song
Tall and high and mighty
They are flowers,
But they’re strong.

Whisper to the Lavender
And she’ll sing you a tune
She’s as quiet as a butterfly
As vibrant as the moon
When the wind
blows around her
Feel laughter through the rain
She will bring you a smile
Even when you’re in pain.

You should know
You’re one in a million
No flowers to compare to
And summer sunshine
isn’t as brilliant
Winters don’t even dare to
Try and freeze up your spirit
But they couldn’t if they tried
Don’t you ever let anybody
Dampen out your light.
