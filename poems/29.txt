El Beso

Angelina Weld Grimké (1880-1958)

Twilight--and you
Quiet--the stars;
Snare of the shine of your teeth,
Your provocative laughter,
The gloom of your hair;
Lure of you, eye and lip;
Yearning, yearning,
Languor, surrender;
Your mouth,
And madness, madness,
Tremulous, breathless, flaming,
The space of a sigh;
Then awakening—remembrance,
Pain, regret--your sobbing;
And again, quiet--the stars,
Twilight--and you.
