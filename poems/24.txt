It happened

By Alex Faith, '21

Drunk on a plane in a pandemic

Doesn’t seem like something could happen

But with germs in the air

And spiders in hair

It all appears mundane somethings.

Take the books off the shelf and burn them

Knowledge killed dead by survival

In a couple years we’ll look back

Smile and laugh

We spread fear quicker than any virus

But breathe now

And

Wash

Your

Hands
