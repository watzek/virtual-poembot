manhã

Marc-Anthony Valle, '22

By the time I wake, the sun is already on its third cup of black coffee.
My nose dry as farofa.
I slept under the air conditioner.
My vovó is asleep still.
Moving her is labor we all shoulder happily.
My oh my oh my how she could love.
Her skin soft palm leaves sunbathing on their back.
I felt my bruises decolor and scratches cauterize when she embraced me.
I wrap her palms around my blistered back.
My vovô is reading now. As he always did.
Wall of leather-bound books behind him, well-worn and colored, as his own binding.
I long to carry him home with me, toting household gods whose names I can’t decipher.
Take him to where the sun is blocked by evergreens.
Carry my grandfather like Anchises.
