Evening Song

Willa Cather (1873-1947)

Dear love, what thing of all the things that be
Is ever worth one thought from you or me,
   Save only Love,
   Save only Love?

The days so short, the nights so quick to flee,
The world so wide, so deep and dark the sea,
   So dark the sea;

So far the suns and every listless star,
Beyond their lightâ€”Ah! dear, who knows how far,
   Who knows how far?

One thing of all dim things I know is true,
The heart within me knows, and tells it you,
   And tells it you.

So blind is life, so long at last is sleep,
And none but Love to bid us laugh or weep,
   And none but Love,
   And none but Love.
