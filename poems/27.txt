Tragedy of the Farmhand

Coltyn Cody, '20

You’ve always had a thing for farmer boys,
The way they till the crops, and cultivate,
The way they spit their seed on fertile mounds,
The way they churn the butter, in and out.
And how you long to be those crops,
To be those mounds,
To be his buttered—
“You're mighty good” escapes in shallow breaths
…
You wish that he was too.
It’s like you always have to do the work,
The heavy lifting left to expert hands.
He flexes and releases, muscles tense
And then relax. They always disappoint.
