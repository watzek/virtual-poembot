late june

By Luke Rotello, '22

beloved me and the cornerstones of my skin,
coated in wild sumac,
tearing up the asphalt
and the telephone wire draped over lilac aroma.

and you pulled the dendrites from the clover flowers,
you dragged the ambrosia through your teeth
hoping for the return of nectar
and magenta to coat your lips.
you were the six closest depths and their ghosts,
the indica flowers that grew in their farthest reaches,
my symbiosis and guilt.

i don't honestly know who this is for.
maybe this is the 100 feet of rock at bishop's creek and her branches,
or the cobwebs under the bridge turned hazel with ivy.
maybe this is levi, eric and the most i ever loved myself.
or maybe this is healing as i wrap myself in the empty roads to stockbridge,
whisking past the sumac,
the clover, the rhododendron,
the heavy of the sunset and her haze.
because i am made of nothing more than hope, i will choose to believe them all,
and trust they will do the same for me.
